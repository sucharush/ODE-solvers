This project provides an implementation of numerical solvers for solving ordinary differential equations (O\+D\+Es), i.\+e. \$y$^\wedge$\{\textquotesingle{}\}(t)=f(t,y(t))\$. The solvers currently support the following methods\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Forward Euler (FE)}}\+: Explicit single-\/step solver.
\item {\bfseries{Runge-\/\+Kutta (RK)}}\+: Explicit single-\/step solver supporting orders 1 through 4.
\item {\bfseries{Adams-\/\+Bashforth (AB)}}\+: Explict multistep solver with configurable order and initialization method (e.\+g., R\+K4, Forward Euler).
\item {\bfseries{Backward Euler (BE)}}\+: Implicit single-\/step solver with optional tolerance and iteration settings.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The default implementation solves the model problem \$y$^\wedge$\{\textquotesingle{}\} = -\/0.\+3y\$ using a 4th-\/order Runge-\/\+Kutta method. The project is modular, allowing customization of solvers, models, and configurations.

The main structure of the project is as follows\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily /config}\+: configuration settings to run the main.
\item {\ttfamily /include}\+: contains all header files.
\item {\ttfamily /src}\+: contains all implementation files.
\item {\ttfamily /test}\+: contains test files, supported by googletest.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{How to}\label{index_autotoc_md4}
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsection{Quick Start}\label{index_autotoc_md5}
First, you need to clone the project repository on your local machine. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{git clone git@gitlab.epfl.ch:ebaup/pcsc-\/project.git}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd pcsc-\/project}
\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsection{Set-\/up and Building}\label{index_autotoc_md6}
The project relies on {\itshape googletest} and {\itshape Eigen}, initialize them as submodules to install these dependencies\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{git submodule update -\/-\/init }
\end{DoxyCode}


You can build the project using your preferred I\+DE (e.\+g., C\+Lion) or the terminal\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{mkdir build}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd build}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake ..}
\DoxyCodeLine{make}
\end{DoxyCode}


After these lines, executable files are produced. Simply run \textquotesingle{}main\textquotesingle{} on your I\+DE, or run the following lines on your terminal\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd .. // or simply open your terminal in the root project folder}
\DoxyCodeLine{./main}
\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsection{Update the Configuration}\label{index_autotoc_md7}

{\bfseries{Note\+:}} It will automatically build the forward Euler method when choosing {\ttfamily order = 1} for Runge Kutta or {\ttfamily steps = 1} for Adams\+Bashforth, as they are the same solvers. \hypertarget{index_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysubsection{Modify the R\+H\+S Function}\label{index_autotoc_md8}
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysection{Limitations}\label{index_autotoc_md9}
We encountered various challenges during the realisation of this project, some were taken care of, and some remain as limitations of our implementation.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysubsection{Solvers classes}\label{index_autotoc_md10}
Our first main challenge was to find a suitable class organisation for the different solvers.

A good knowledge of the methods was needed to understand how they relate with each other, and what were their common and specific characteristics. There are different approaches we thought about, and we decided to split the methods between two main categories\+: {\bfseries{explicit}} and {\bfseries{implicit}}. The explicit methods can be single-\/step or multi-\/step methods.

Another approach we thought about was to separate in two other categories\+: Runge-\/\+Kutta and linear multi-\/step methods. Then linear multi-\/step methods could have been split between explicit and implicit and would have been determined by their weights.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md11}{}\doxysubsection{Function class}\label{index_autotoc_md11}
Our second main challenge was to create a function class, and handle the derivatives. We decided to create a base class ({\ttfamily O\+D\+E\+Righ\+Hand\+Side}) and two children that correspond to functions for which we know the derivative and for which we do not. If the derivative is not known, it is approximated with centered differences.

There are however a few limitations with our approach. First, we can only use the functions that are in the file {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{_example_r_h_s_8h_source}{Example\+R\+H\+S.\+h}}}. An improvement would be to have a parser that lets the user write their function. The user would also need to specify if they want to use the known derivative for the function. This could be done either by letting the user specify the derivative, or by having a derivative calculator accessible in the project.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md12}{}\doxysubsection{Dimension of the O\+DE}\label{index_autotoc_md12}
The main limitation of our project is that it focuses strictly on O\+D\+Es that are from \$\textbackslash{}mathbb\{R\} \textbackslash{}times \textbackslash{}mathbb\{R\}\$ to \$\textbackslash{}mathbb\{R\}\$, i.\+e. \$y,t\$ are real and so is \$f(t,y)\$. Possible extensions could be
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item allowing \$y\$ to be a vector, i.\+e. in \$\textbackslash{}mathbb\{R\}$^\wedge$n\$
\item allowing \$f\$ to be a vector-\/valued function, i.\+e. solve a system of O\+D\+Es
\item allowing \$y\$ to be a complex number, or a complex-\/valued vector, etc.
\end{DoxyItemize}

For this a few solutions we thought about were to use template classes and/or Eigen vectors for \$y\$.
